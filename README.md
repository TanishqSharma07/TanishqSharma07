- ⚡ Fun fact: The term "bug" in the context of computer programming originated in 1947 when Grace Hopper,
                an American computer scientist, found an actual moth causing a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer.
                She removed the insect and taped it into the logbook, noting, "First actual case of bug being found."
                Since then, "bug" has been commonly used to refer to any error or glitch in a computer program.
